request closed, and we will ignore you if you break this rule.

## What API should I use as a reference?
Always up-to-date Iceshrimp.NET with all non-essential values nullable. Most Iceshrimp.NET instances will have an API
reference at `/swagger`. If you don't know any, you can use https://next.iceshrimp.dev/.

## Shared solutions before platform-specific solutions
Too many platform-specific solutions can cause problems with either platform's implementation
to go unnoticed if a change is only tested on one platform. Always prefer a shared solution over one that
requires platform-specific implementations (`expect`/`actual` functions).

## Adding icons
We use Material Icons, which you can find here: https://fonts.google.com/icons. Icons can be two sizes: 20px or 24px.
To add an icon, click on it, swap the tab to "Android" in the opened sidebar, and download the XML.
Prefix that file with `icon_`, then drop it in `shared/commonMain/composeResources/drawable`.
Change the color from `@android/*` to `#000000`, otherwise the app will instantly crash.
